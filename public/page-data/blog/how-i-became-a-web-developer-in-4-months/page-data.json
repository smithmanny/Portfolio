Well to be honest maybe a little more than 4 months. It all started back in my junior year of high school. I took my first computer class which was \\\"HTML/CSS Introduction\\\". This was back in 2010 so I'm not sure if responsive design was already out, but I do know that we didn't learn it. This class was just going over the basics of web development, we never built anything \\\"amazing\\\" just some plain simple websites with a little of styling.

Well fortunately for me I left in November and signed up Team Treehouse.

I couldn't stop sweating, I started getting chills through my body, and I was sweating so much I felt like I starting smelling. I finally sat down with the manager of the office and we start the conversation about me. She wanted to get to know me better and what I knew and didn't know. So I was honest with her, I mean she already knew because she viewed my resume. After telling her I was self-taught and just started, she ended up telling me more about the company and what my role would be.
