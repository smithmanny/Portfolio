As I took my first Software Engineering job I was given a new MacBook Pro since the position was working remotely. And as you probably guess, I had to install all of my applications over to the new laptop. While configuring my new laptop, I figured I'll make a list of applications and tools I use every day as a developer. (Keep in mind some of these apps are only for Mac OS)

Obviously, these are not all the apps I use day-to-day, but while I'm programming these are the most important applications. As I mature into my career I will stumble across new applications and will try to keep this list up to date.
