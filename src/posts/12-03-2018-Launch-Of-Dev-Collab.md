I've been thinking about this project idea for a while now and finally decided to start on it. Well as of December 2, 2018, Iâ€™ve released the Beta version of [Dev Collab](https://devcollab.org) ðŸŽŠ. And when I mean beta I mean more like Alpha lol, but I wanted to release this project young and watch it mature with its users. The reason I created this project was to help new programmers jump in and start working on projects with a group. Some people are afraid or just donâ€™t know where to look when it comes time finding projects to gain some experience.

Currently, everything is handled with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/ElIWUPZu) in the backend, but working on converting the project to using Firebase. The reason I choose Firebase is that it just allows me to grow the project at a faster pace than setting up my own server. I like to have full control over things though so maybe in the future Iâ€™ll convert this project ðŸ¤”.

### Upcoming Features
As of now, users have to click a button which opens up an Airtable form. Once the user fills out the form with their information itâ€™s then displayed on Dev Collab home page. If a user wants to modify or delete their project, they will have to contact me via Twitter and Iâ€™ll remove it for them. So with that said here are some of Dev Collab upcoming features:
- User Account
* Link Firebase (DB/Auth)
* Sync Github projects 
* Modify/Delete projects
* Better UI/UX design??
* And some moreâ€¦

These features will start to roll out in the coming weeks so stay tuned!
